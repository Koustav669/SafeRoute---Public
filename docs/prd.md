## 6. Technical Implementation

### 6.1 API Integration
\n#### 6.1.1 Google Maps API
- **API Key**:
- **Services Used**:
  - Google Maps JavaScript API for map rendering\n  - Google Places API for location autocomplete in start location and destination fields
  - Google Routes API for retrieving route data
  - Google Maps Geolocation API for fetching user's current location
  - Google Maps Directions API for turn-by-turn navigation guidance

#### 6.1.2 Gemini AI Integration
- **API Key**: - **Purpose**: Generate three route options with safety analysis\n- **Input Data**:
  - Origin coordinates (start location)
  - Destination coordinates
  - Departure time (selected travel time)
  - Location context and time of day
- **Output**: Three route options with the following data for each:
  - Route geometry (polyline for map rendering)
  - Route type: Safest / Balanced / Fastest
  - Estimated duration and distance
  - Safety Score (0-100)
  - Natural language safety explanation
  - Safety recommendations specific to the route
- **Implementation Workflow**:
  1. User inputs start location and destination (with autocomplete support)
  2. User selects travel time
  3. User clicks 'Find Safe Routes' button
  4. System sends request to Gemini AI with origin, destination, and time data
  5. Gemini AI returns three routes: Safest, Balanced, Fastest
  6. Each route includes Safety Score, safety explanation, and recommendations
  7. Routes are rendered on map with color coding (green, yellow, grey)\n  8. Route comparison cards display all three options
  9. When user selects a route, Safety Analysis Panel updates with that route's explanation and recommendations

#### 6.1.3 Route Selection and Navigation Workflow
1. User selects one of the three routes from comparison cards
2. Selected route is highlighted on map
3. Safety Analysis Panel updates with route-specific safety explanation and recommendations
4. 'Start Navigation' button becomes visible
5. User clicks 'Start Navigation'\n6. System fetches user's current location via Google Maps Geolocation API
7. Google Maps Directions API provides turn-by-turn navigation:\n   - Step-by-step directions (text and voice)
   - Real-time location tracking
   - Distance and time to next turn
   - Visual route progress on map
   - Estimated arrival time
8. Navigation continues until user reaches destination or clicks 'End Navigation'

### 6.2 Safety Score Calculation
- **Current Implementation**: Temporary formula with freedom to use any reasonable calculation method
- **Future Implementation**: Custom formula to be provided by user later
- **Score Range**: 0-100 (higher score indicates safer route)
- **Factors Considered** (for temporary formula):
  - Lighting conditions along route
  - Foot traffic density at travel time
  - Proximity to commercial areas
  - Street type (main roads vs isolated paths)
  - Community safety feedback

### 6.3 Map Integration
- Google Map embed with route visualization
- Dynamic route highlighting based on user selection
- Interactive route selection\n- Real-time location display during navigation
- Turn-by-turn navigation overlay

### 6.4 Backend Architecture
- API request handling for Gemini AI
- Route data processing and safety score calculation
- Response formatting for frontend display
- Navigation data processing from Google Maps Directions API

### 6.5 Emergency Features
- SOS button triggers mock emergency alert
- Displays live location and selected route
- Simulates trusted contact notification
\n### 6.6 Community Features
- Anonymous safety feedback submission
- Area marking system (safe/unsafe)
- Recency-weighted reporting
\n## 7. Design Philosophy\n
The website should feel like 'a quiet, reliable companion walking beside you at night' - not a flashy startup or panic app, but a calm guardian that is serious, trustworthy, protective, minimal, and purpose-driven.
