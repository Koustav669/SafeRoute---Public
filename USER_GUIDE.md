# SafeRoute - The Complete User Guide
*Your Companion for Safer Travel*

Welcome to **SafeRoute**, the intelligent navigation app designed to prioritize your safety above all else. Unlike standard map apps that only show you the *fastest* way, SafeRoute analyzes lighting, crime data, and road conditions to show you the *safest* way.

This guide will explain every feature in detail so you can travel with confidence.

## 🌟 Unique Selling Points (Why SafeRoute?)

1.  **Safety Over Speed**: We calculate routes based on how safe they are, not just how fast they are.
2.  **AI-Powered Analyst**: We use advanced Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini) to "read" the route for you, warning you about dark alleys or isolated stretches.
3.  **Relative Scoring**: We compare routes against each other. If all roads are risky, we guide you to the *least risky* one.
4.  **Community Driven**: Real-time safety scores are updated by users like you who report safe or unsafe zones.
5.  **One-Touch SOS**: A powerful emergency system built right into the navigation screen.

## 📱 How to Use: Step-by-Step

### 1. Planning Your Journey
When you open the app, you will see the **"Plan Your Safe Journey"** box on the left (or top on mobile).

*   **Start Location**:
    *   **Type to Search**: Start typing your current location (e.g., "Times Square"). A dropdown list will appear—just like in Uber or Google Maps—so you can pick the exact spot without typing the full address.
    *   **Use Current Location**: Click the small "Navigation Arrow" button next to the input box. The app will automatically find where you are.
*   **Destination**:
    *   Start typing where you want to go. Select the correct place from the list.
*   **Travel Time**:
    *   By default, this shows the current time.
    *   **Planning Ahead?** You can change this! If you plan to walk home at 11:00 PM, set it to "23:00". The app will calculate safety based on *that* time (e.g., it knows streetlights might be dimmer or shops closed).
*   **Travel Mode**:
    *   **Walking**: Prioritizes sidewalks and well-lit pedestrian areas.
    *   **Two Wheeler**: Optimizes for bike/scooter safety.
    *   **Four Wheeler**: Standard driving routes.
    *   **Public Transport**: Shows bus/transit routes.

### 2. Choosing Your Route
Once you click **"Find Safe Routes"**, the map will light up with up to three distinct lines:

*   **🟢 The Recommended Route (Safest)**:
    *   **Color**: Green / Teal.
    *   **Why choose this?** This route has the highest Safety Score. It might take 2-3 minutes longer, but it sticks to main roads, well-lit areas, and busy streets.
*   **🟡 The Balanced Route**:
    *   **Color**: Yellow.
    *   **Why choose this?** A middle ground. It's faster than the safest route but might have one or two quieter streets.
*   **⚫ The Fastest Route (Use with Caution)**:
    *   **Color**: Grey/Black.
    *   **Why choose this?** Only if you are in a rush. This is the standard "Google Maps" path, which often takes shortcuts through dark alleys or empty parks to save time.

### 3. Understanding the "Safety Score"
Below the map, you will see a detailed **Safety Analysis Card**. This is the brain of the app.

*   **The Score (0-100)**:
    *   **75+ (Green)**: Very Safe. Wide roads, lights, people around.
    *   **50-74 (Yellow)**: Moderate. Be standardly cautious.
    *   **Below 50 (Red)**: Risky. Avoid if possible, or travel with a friend.
*   **AI Analysis**:
    *   You will read a paragraph written by our AI. It interprets the data like a human friend would: *"This route is safer because it avoids the dark narrow lane behind the market and keeps you on the main avenue."*
*   **Risk Factors Breakdown**:
    *   We show you exactly *why* a score is low.
    *   🚨 **Crime Risk**: Is this area known for safety issues?
    *   💡 **Lighting**: Are there streetlights?
    *   🌙 **Time**: Is it late night?
    *   🛣️ **Road Type**: Is it a main highway or a narrow "gali" (lane)?

## 🚨 The SOS Emergency System
We hope you never need this, but it is there if you do.

### Quick Access
In the top right corner of the screen, you will always see a big red **SOS Button**.

### Features inside the SOS Menu:
1.  **Hold for Quick Send**:
    *   **How it works**: Simply press and **HOLD** the SOS button for 3 seconds.
    *   **What it does**: It automatically triggers your default emergency action (like sending a WhatsApp message with your live location) without making you click through menus.
2.  **Share Live Location**:
    *   Generates a link to your exact coordinates. You can copy this and send it to anyone.
3.  **Emergency Contacts**:
    *   **WhatsApp**: One tap opens WhatsApp with a pre-typed message: *"Emergency! I need help. My location: [Link]"*.
    *   **Call Police (100)**: One tap to dial.
    *   **Call Ambulance (102)**: One tap to dial.

*Tip: Go to "Settings" inside the SOS menu to save your emergency contacts (Mom, Dad, Partner) so the WhatsApp button sends the message to them instantly.*

    *   Mark it as "Unsafe" and select reasons (Poor Lighting, Deserted).
    *   **Immediate Impact**: This lowers the safety score of that area for *everyone else* using the app instantly.
